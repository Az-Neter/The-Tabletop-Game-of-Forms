The Tabletop Game of Forms is an enhanced version of the [classic game](https://github.com/Az-Neter/The-Game-of-Forms) reworked as a multiplayer RPG


# Rules (First Draft)

The Tabletop Game of Forms is an imagination-based shadow game for occult practitioners. It serves as a tool for self-discovery and personal growth, allowing players to interact with their hidden attributes within a group ritual setting.

The primary goal of the game is to foster self-understanding by facilitating interaction with archetypes within the collective unconscious. This is achieved through a series of prompts, challenges, and roleplaying activities that encourage players to confront their fears, overcome limitations, and integrate their hidden aspects.


Description:  
A group of 3-5 players gathers in a quiet and dimly lit space. The Game Master (GM) sets the scene with evocative descriptions and prompts, creating a ritualistic atmosphere.  
Each player crafts their shadow aspects to explore during the session.

Tools:  
• Dice: d20, d10, d6, d4  
• Coin  
• Pen and paper  

Character Creation:  
Your character sheet records information about who you are as a person.  
Each player chooses from the list of available archetypes which most closely resemble their personalities, or those which they wish to explore within their psyche.  
To guide their inner exploration, players choose two archetypes:  
• Bestial Archetype (Animal Spirit): Representing primal instincts and unconscious drives.  
• God-Form (Patron Deity): Embodying an overarching idea, a guiding force.  

The chosen symbols are given to their GM at the beginning of play.

Any additional archetypes or symbols one has explored are added to your sheet and may be referenced in game at any time.

Archetypes from the current game are only added at the conclusion of the game.

You record the following information on your sheet:  
• Chosen Name  
(Used only in-game, should not be shared outside of the circle)  
• Mastered Archetypes  
(Added to over time as you explore new symbols)  
• Black Soul Mirror  
(Your worst traits and habits)  
• White Soul Mirror  
(Your greatest skills and achievements)  
• Symbols  
(Any sigils, rotes or images given to you by guides, by your GM, or designed by yourself personally)  
• Guides  
(Named entities which are embraced within your paradigm, does not need to be exhaustive)  



Gameplay:  
The ritual unfolds in three distinct phases;

• Staging  
Starting the ritual, setting the scene;
The group gathers, setting the intention for the ritual through a brief ceremony that focuses their energy and intentions.
The group decides on a central theme for the ritual, such as a personal challenge, a fear to overcome, or a creative goal.
The GM paints a vivid scene, immersing them in a captivating narrative tailored to the chosen theme, casting a circle of contained experience.

• The Cycle  
Aspects of play;  
The Game Master (GM) prepares a series of prompts, challenges, and questions designed to guide the players on their journey of self-discovery. These should be based on the chosen theme and the players' archetypes.  
The GM assumes the role of the Shadow, an enigmatic being representing the players' collective unconscious.  
The Shadow interacts with the players through riddles, challenges, and prompts, guiding them on their journey of self-discovery.  
The players take turns facing various challenges and prompts related to their chosen archetypes. These challenges may involve physical actions, creative expression, dialogue, or inner reflection.  
Players act as themselves, embodying their chosen archetype and interacting with their Shadow. The GM reflects the players' attributes back to them through roleplay, allowing them to see themselves from a new perspective.  
The Shadow presents the players with challenges and mysteries to solve. These challenges are designed to help the players confront their fears, overcome their limitations, and integrate their hidden aspects.  
The GM interprets the results of player dice rolls and coin flips to receive guidance and insights from the players archetypes.  
The GM facilitates the process of personal growth by reflecting the players' attributes, asking questions, and providing prompts to help them integrate their hidden aspects.

Interpreting the Dice;  
The dice and coin serve as oracles, providing guidance and insights into the players' archetypal energies. Each roll and flip offers a piece of the puzzle, helping the GM decipher the messages from the players' subconscious minds.  
• d20 (Fate): Represents the unpredictable forces of the universe and the player's destiny.  
• d10 (Mind): Represents the player's thoughts, intellect, and conscious awareness.  
• d6 (Emotion): Represents the player's feelings, desires, and passions.  
• d4 (Instinct): Represents the player's primal urges and unconscious drives.  
• Coin (Yin and Yang): Represents the duality of existence and the need for balance.  
It is up to GM discretion based on their understanding of numerology how they wish to interpret rolls.

• Spiral  
Pitfalls and Problems;  
There are a number of common issues that can arise from shadow play:  
The most common issue arises from uncomfortable confrontations with a reflection from the players. It's possible to have an overly-aggresive GM, or one which reflects attributes the players do not wish to confront in themselves.  
It's important to set boundaries ahead of time and ensure that when limits are pushed, it does not push players away from the table.

• Conclusion  
Closing the Circle, ending the game;  
The journey reaches its climax as players face their innermost fears and vulnerabilities head-on. Through this process of confronting and ultimately embracing their shadows, they emerge transformed, empowered, and more fully realized individuals.  
After completing the challenges and prompts, the players should take some time to reflect on their experiences.  
The group performs a closing ritual to ground their energy and integrate their experiences.


Additional Notes:  

• The GM should encourage creativity and interpretation during the ritual. The dice rolls and coin flips are meant to be guides, not rigid rules.  
• The players should feel safe and supported to express themselves authentically and openly during the roleplaying.  
• The ritual may be repeated multiple times with different themes and archetypes to deepen the self-discovery process.  
• The GM should be familiar with occult and esoteric principles to guide the players' journey.

• Needing a Knowledgeable Game Master: The game requires a Game Master who is familiar with occult and esoteric principles. This can be a challenge, as there are not many people who have this knowledge.  
• Triggering Issues: The game can be emotionally challenging, as it requires players to confront their shadows. This may trigger emotional issues or lead to psychological distress.  
• Potential for Misuse: The game can be misused by individuals who are not experienced with shadow work or occult practice. This can lead to negative experiences, such as spiritual delusions or psychological harm.
